# Statements

We have a lot of statements :3

## If / Else

We have basic if/else statements

```
if thing {
    //...
} else if otherThing {
    //...
} else {
    //...
}
```

Note: There are no parenthesis around the booleans.

## Loops

We also have some loops, that being, `for`, `for in`, `while`, and `loop`.

`for` is your basic, C-style, for loop.

```
for x = 0, x < 5, x++ {
    //...
}
```

`for in` iterates over a range

```
for x in 0..5 {
    //...
}
```

`while` executes while a value is true

```
while thing {
    //...
}
```

`loop` is an infinite loop (like `while true`)

```
loop {
    //...
}
```
