# Gekker

This is a programming language built specifically towards my needs. It is (by definition)
extremely opinionated.

## Look at the [Specification](spec/)!

## Core Principles

- I want the language to be unambiguous, for both the reader and compiler.
    Syntax should feel close to "plain english"
- I want language features to encourage the way in which I program
